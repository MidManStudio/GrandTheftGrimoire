# Benching Standards

How this project's `bench-vs-*.yml`/`Abench-*.yml` workflows are
structured, so a new one doesn't have to rediscover the pattern (or skip
part of it) each time. Written after `bench-vs-bevy-ecs.yml` shipped
without the structured-summary step this doc describes — checked
directly against every existing bench workflow rather than assumed.

## The real, current state: two patterns, not one

Grepping every `bench-vs-*.yml`/`Abench-*.yml` file turned up two
genuinely different approaches in active use, not one consistent
standard:

1. **Python parser** (`bench-vs-mat4-fastest.yml`, `bench-vs-color.yml`,
   `bench-vs-c-libs.yml`, `bench-vs-mid-vec.yml`, and others) — a
   `scripts/bench_vs_*.py` script parses the raw criterion output into
   real per-group markdown tables, optionally with a ratio-vs-baseline
   column and colored badges.
2. **Bash grep + collapsible raw dump** (`bench-mid-collections-sparse-
   set.yml`) — no Python, just `grep -B 1 "time:"` for a quick headline
   table plus the full raw log behind a `<details>` fold.

Both are legitimate for what they show. Neither is "wrong." But a bench
workflow written without deliberately picking one (what `bench-vs-bevy-
ecs.yml` did originally) ends up with neither — just a raw, unparsed
wall of criterion text in the step summary, which is the actual problem
this doc exists to prevent from happening again.

**Recommendation for new bench workflows:** use the Python parser
pattern when there's a natural per-group baseline to compute a ratio
against (a "vs X" comparison, which is most of them) — it's the more
information-dense summary and the one worth writing once, correctly,
and reusing the shape of. Fall back to the bash pattern only for
something that doesn't have a clean baseline concept.

## The correctness detail that actually matters more than formatting

**`set -o pipefail` is not optional.** `cargo bench ... | tee raw.txt`
without it means the step's exit code is `tee`'s (always `0`), not
`cargo bench`'s — a real benchmark failure shows green. This was a real
incident (see `Abench-vs-all-f64.yml`'s own "Run f64 criterion
benchmarks" step comment and `mid-ecs-test.yml`'s), and it's why
`mid-ecs-test.yml`, `bench-mid-collections-sparse-set.yml`, and four of
the `bench-vs-*.yml` files have it. **Checked directly: 12 of the
`bench-vs-*.yml` files — including `bench-vs-mat4-fastest.yml`, the one
`bench-vs-bevy-ecs.yml` was originally modeled on — do not have it.**
Not fixed as part of this pass (real, but out of scope for what was
asked); worth a deliberate cleanup pass, not a silent gap to
rediscover the hard way later.

## The step-summary size limit — a real, hard GitHub constraint, not a formatting choice

GitHub caps `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` at 1024 KiB total; write past it and
the *entire* summary for that step is dropped, with only a terse
`GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY upload aborted... got NNNk` line in the log to say
why — no partial summary, no indication of which content pushed it
over. Hit for real on `bench-mid-ecs-archetype-core.yml` (1065k against
the 1024k limit), on the run right after a new diagnostic bench group
landed — the natural read is "too much new bench data," and it's wrong.
A `raw_slice_ceiling`-only local run (8 benchmark instances total, no
other group involved) produced 712,833 bytes and 18,952 lines on its
own, and all but ~68 of those lines were `cargo bench`'s own build
output — specifically a `warning: \`mid-math\` (lib) generated 3110
warnings` worth of compiler lint noise (unnecessary-`unsafe`,
missing-docs, and similar, from mid-math's own SIMD backends),
captured because the run step's `2>&1 | tee raw.txt` pipes stderr
(where rustc's warnings go) into the same file a later step `cat`s
whole into the step summary. Real criterion result text is tiny by
comparison — roughly 8-9 lines per benchmark instance; even every group
`archetype_core.rs` has as of this pass (~76 instances total) comes to
maybe 600-700 lines, well under 100 KB.

**The bench data was never the risk. The compiler-warning preamble —
which reappears in full on any cache miss, for any crate anywhere in
the dependency graph, regardless of what the bench file itself
contains — is.** A cold cache (GitHub Actions cache eviction, a
`Cargo.toml` touch, or just a repo with enough *other* bench workflows
competing for the same repo-wide 10 GB cache quota) can reintroduce
thousands of warning lines at any time, on any of these workflows, with
zero relationship to how much the benchmarks themselves grew.

**Fix, applied to `bench-mid-ecs-archetype-core.yml`,
`bench-mid-collections-sparse-set.yml`, and `bench-mid-ecs-sparse-
shell.yml`** (`grep -l "Full raw output" .github/workflows/*.yml` shows
these are the only three using the raw-`cat` pattern, so all three
carried the same latent risk): before embedding the raw log in the step
summary, skip everything before cargo's own `` Finished `bench` profile ``
marker — the line it always prints once compilation succeeds, right
before the benchmarked binary actually runs — so only real bench
output reaches the summary, no build noise. Falls back to the untouched
full log if that marker is missing entirely (a genuine compile
failure, where the noise upstream of it *is* the signal and must not
be hidden). A defensive `head -c 900000` cap sits behind that either
way — current real output isn't remotely close to it, but it means
this specific failure mode structurally can't recur here regardless of
how much more diagnostic bench code gets added later. The untouched raw
file, warnings and all, still goes to the uploaded artifact unchanged —
nothing lost, just kept off the size-capped surface.

**New bench workflows: don't `cat` a raw `cargo bench`/`cargo test` log
into `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` without stripping the pre-`` Finished ``
build output first.** A clean sandbox or a cold cache brings it back in
full, on any crate, at any time — it has nothing to do with how much
the bench file itself has grown, so growth in the bench matrix is not
what to watch for here; cache-miss frequency is.

## The recommended shape, end to end

What `bench-vs-bevy-ecs.yml` now does, as the canonical reference:

1. `workflow_dispatch` only, with a free-text `baseline_note` input.
   **Never** `push`/`pull_request` — benchmarks take real time and
   shouldn't run on every commit.
2. `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` (tracks true latest stable) +
   `rustc --version` captured to a step output for the summary header.
   If the target crate has a real MSRV wall above whatever the sandbox
   this was written in could reach, say so explicitly in the workflow's
   own header comment — this project doesn't hide toolchain gaps.
3. Cache the cargo registry, keyed on the relevant `Cargo.toml`(s).
4. Run the bench with **`set -o pipefail`** set first, `tee`'d to a
   `bench-<name>-raw.txt` file.
5. `if: always()` **diagnostics step** — `grep` the raw log for
   criterion's own warning strings (`took zero time`, `Unable to
   complete`, `Warning:`, `panicked`, `Completed N iterations`) into
   their own step-summary block. Cheap, and it surfaces real sampling
   problems (a real one showed up in `bench-vs-bevy-ecs.yml`'s first
   actual run — criterion couldn't complete 100 samples in 5s for the
   `bevy_ecs` structural-churn case, extended to 7.5s on its own) that
   would otherwise sit buried in a wall of raw text.
6. `if: always()` **summary step** — either the Python parser or the
   bash-grep pattern above, not the raw dump alone. If it embeds any
   slice of the raw log (even inside a `<details>` fold), strip
   everything before cargo's own `` Finished `bench` profile `` marker
   first and cap the result (e.g. `head -c 900000`) — see "The
   step-summary size limit" above for why a raw `cat` of build output
   plus bench output is a real, GitHub-hard-capped failure mode, not a
   formatting nicety.
7. `if: always()` **upload the raw log as an artifact**, 30-day
   retention, *untouched* — no stripping or capping here, that's only
   for the step-summary embed. The step summary is for skimming; the
   raw file is for when someone actually needs the full confidence
   intervals (or the build warnings the summary deliberately left out).

## Writing a `scripts/bench_vs_*.py`

Real, working shape (see `scripts/bench_vs_bevy_ecs.py` for the current
reference implementation, adapted from `bench_vs_mat4_fastest.py`):

- Strip ANSI codes first (`RE_ANSI`), criterion colors its output.
- `RE_RESULT` matches criterion's real `name\n    time: [lo mid hi]`
  shape — grounded in `report.rs`'s actual source at whatever criterion
  version is pinned, not memory. `bench-mid-collections-sparse-set.yml`
  found this the hard way (see its own header comment): it wrote a
  parser it could never actually run against real output at the time,
  since the sandbox that wrote it couldn't get `cargo bench` running at
  all — grounded in real source, but a real workflow trigger was still
  the first actual proof. Where possible, test the parser against real
  captured output before trusting it, the way `bench_vs_bevy_ecs.py`
  was checked against this workflow's own first real run.
- Group results by everything before the final `/` in the benchmark
  name (`spawn_n_entities_two_components/mid-ecs` → group
  `spawn_n_entities_two_components`, variant `mid-ecs`).
- If one variant per group is the natural baseline (a reference
  implementation, or — for a two-engine comparison like `vs_bevy_ecs`
  — the *other* engine), compute a ratio and badge it:
  `≤1.05× parity`, `≤1.5× warn`, `≤5.0× error`, `>5.0×` flagged as
  overhead-dominated. Don't hardcode a *reason* for a bad ratio in the
  script unless it's a real, separately-diagnosed root cause (the way
  `bench_vs_mat4_fastest.py` does for its own, already-profiled
  storage-layout issue) — a first-ever run's script should report
  honestly, not guess.

  benches exist at all (comparing against a reference implementation).
- `docs/mid-ecs.md`, `docs/mid-math.md` — the design context a given
  bench's numbers should get read against.

## Benchmarking across runners and platforms

This is a real, separate axis from the summary-formatting stuff above,
and `bench-vs-bevy-ecs.yml` didn't have it either on first write —
checked directly against what's actually in this repo (`Abench-vs-all-
f64.yml`, `mid-math-test-neon.yml`, `test-geom.yml`) rather than
assumed. Two genuinely different concerns, easy to conflate:

### 1. ISA-tier SIMD dispatch matrix — only for vectorized, dispatched-backend code

`Abench-vs-all-f64.yml` (and its f32 counterpart) sweep a real
`target_cpu` `workflow_dispatch` choice input — `native`, `x86-64-v4`
(AVX-512), `x86-64-v3` (AVX2+FMA), `x86-64-v2` (SSE4.2), `x86-64`
(SSE2-only), `neon`, `wasm`, `scalar` — because mid-math genuinely
*has* a different dispatched SIMD backend per ISA tier
(`f32/{sse2,avx,neon,wasm}/`), and the whole point of the matrix is
proving the right backend gets picked and actually performs on each
real tier. Real mechanics worth reusing wherever this pattern actually
applies:

- **`CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_RUSTFLAGS`, not plain
  `RUSTFLAGS`**, for the target-cpu flag — plain `RUSTFLAGS` also
  applies to build-script (host) compilation, which `SIGILL`s if the
  runner's *real* CPU doesn't have the requested ISA (GitHub-hosted
  `ubuntu-latest` runners are AMD EPYC, no AVX-512).
- **Soft-gate hardware you can't guarantee**: `x86-64-v4` checks
  `/proc/cpuinfo` for `avx512f` first and marks the run
  skipped-not-failed with an explanatory step summary if it's absent,
  rather than actually attempting a `SIGILL`ing run.
- **Real ARM coverage exists and is cheap**: `mid-math-test-neon.yml`
  runs on `macos-14` (Apple Silicon M1) — GitHub's free-tier hosted
  ARM runner, not a self-hosted rig. `neon` in the f64/f32 bench
  matrices runs on `ubuntu-24.04-arm` instead (also free-tier hosted),
  with `-C target-cpu=native` as plain `RUSTFLAGS` — safe there
  specifically because host and target are the same architecture, so
  no cross-compile SIGILL risk the x86 tiers have.
- **wasm needs `wasmtime` + a `.cargo/config.toml` runner shim** to
  actually execute — see the `wasm` branch for the exact
  `[target.wasm32-wasip1]` config.

**When a bench does NOT need this matrix — real, already-established
precedent, not new**: `bench-mid-collections-sparse-set.yml`'s own
header comment explains it directly — `SparseSet`'s performance is
governed by cache locality and pointer-chasing, not vectorizable
arithmetic, so there's no ISA tier to sweep. **The same reasoning
applies to `vs_bevy_ecs.rs`** — `spawn`/`dense_query_iteration`/
`structural_churn` are all archetype-migration, hashmap-lookup, and
`Box<dyn Any>`-boxing bound, not SIMD arithmetic bound. Neither
`bench-mid-collections-sparse-set.yml` nor `bench-vs-bevy-ecs.yml` carry
the `target_cpu` matrix, and that's a deliberate omission, not a gap —
don't add one without a real, dispatched-SIMD-backend reason to.

### 2. Cross-OS/cross-arch portability — a different, still-real concern

Independent of SIMD: does the thing actually build and behave the same
on Linux, macOS, and Windows? `test-geom.yml`'s pattern is the
reference — a plain `strategy.matrix.os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest,
windows-latest]` with `fail-fast: false`, no ISA-tier logic at all,
just "does this work everywhere Mid Engine cares about."

This is the piece `bench-vs-bevy-ecs.yml` was missing and now has: an
opt-in `platforms` `workflow_dispatch` choice (`ubuntu-only` fast
default, `all` for the full `ubuntu-latest` + `macos-latest` +
`ubuntu-24.04-arm` sweep) — opt-in rather than every-run, because
`bevy_ecs`'s ~400-crate dependency tree makes each platform's build
alone take real minutes, and this bench doesn't need to pay that on
every invocation the way a plain correctness test-matrix (`test-
geom.yml`) does on every dispatch. Reach for `all` before trusting a
cross-platform performance claim from this bench specifically, not by
default.

# GTG application

How this repo applies the standard above. Update this section whenever a workflow, script or benchmark changes.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `npc-rust-ci.yml` | push/PR on `rust/**`, `Assets/NPC/**`, `Assets/MidManStudio/Gtg/NPC/**`, manual | Correctness gate: enum sync check (MDIX/C#/Rust), `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo test --workspace`, Clippy `-D warnings`. Publishes a short test-result summary. |
| `npc-rust-ffi-bench.yml` | **manual only** (`workflow_dispatch`) | Rust direct-call vs real C-to-Rust FFI benchmark of `gtg_npc_decide_batch`, plus the C ABI smoke test. |

Formatting, tests and Clippy used to be inside the bench workflow, which also ran on every push. That broke the
standard's rule 1 (never `push`/`pull_request` for benchmarks) and made a formatting slip look like a benchmark
failure. They are now separated.

## How the bench workflow maps to the standard

| Standard | GTG implementation |
|---|---|
| Dispatch-only, free-text note | `workflow_dispatch` with `baseline_note` and a `platforms` choice |
| Toolchain version in header | `rustc --version` captured to a step output; runner CPU/arch written to `bench-out/runner.txt` |
| Cache | `Swatinem/rust-cache`, keyed per runner OS |
| `set -o pipefail` | Set in `defaults.run.shell: bash` **and** explicitly in every step that pipes to `tee` |
| Diagnostics step | `if: always()`; greps build/smoke/bench logs for `panicked`, `error`, `warning:`, `FAIL`, `Segmentation`, `Aborted` |
| Parsed summary | `scripts/bench_npc_ffi.py` builds the ratio table; raw text only inside `<details>` |
| Size cap | Everything before cargo's `Finished` marker is stripped and each embed is capped at 200 KB |
| Raw artifact | `if: always()`, 30 days, untouched files in `rust/bench-out/` |

`scripts/bench_npc_ffi.py` is CI tooling only. It is not part of the game, and the NPC training and inference
pipeline stays pure Rust. The baseline in each row is the Rust direct-call figure. The ratio is the C-to-FFI
figure divided by that baseline, with the standard's badges (`<=1.05x` parity, `<=1.5x` warn, `<=5.0x` error,
otherwise overhead-dominated). Two runs of the same code will not be exactly 1.00x; do not read noise as overhead.
The script was tested against real output from CI run #3 (see below), not invented samples.

## Cross-platform axis

The ISA-tier SIMD matrix from the standard does **not** apply: the NPC decision code has no dispatched SIMD
backends, and its cost is branch and memory bound. The cross-OS/arch axis does apply, because the Galaxy A13 is
aarch64 and the MacBook Pro is a separate x86-64 target.

- `platforms = ubuntu-only` (default): `ubuntu-latest` (x86-64).
- `platforms = all`: adds `ubuntu-24.04-arm` (closest hosted proxy for A13 aarch64 codegen) and `macos-latest`.

Status: only the `ubuntu-latest` leg has run. The ARM and macOS legs are **unverified**. macOS compiles the C
callers with clang under `-Werror -pedantic` and loads a `.dylib`, so a failure there may be a flag issue rather
than a real regression. None of these runners substitutes for measuring the phone and the MacBook directly.

## Why the earlier summary was missing or poor

Checked against the workflow as it stood at commit `9e8ff11`:

- `npc-rust-ci.yml` never wrote to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, so it could not produce one.
- `npc-rust-ffi-bench.yml` did have a summary step, but it only dumped raw text: no parsed table, no ratio, no
  diagnostics and no size cap. That is the failure mode the standard's opening section describes.
- Neither workflow set `pipefail`. GitHub's default `run` shell is `bash -e`, without `pipefail`, so a failing
  `cargo run ... | tee file` would have passed. A green run was weaker evidence than it looked.

I could not open the run page or job logs from the authoring environment (unauthenticated GitHub API rate limit),
so I cannot say what the summary tab actually showed for runs #2 and #3. If the new workflow still shows no summary,
check the run's **Summary** tab rather than the job log, and look for a `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY upload aborted` line.

## Known limits of the current benchmark

- Every NPC in a batch has identical input (an enemy, health 0.8, threat visible). Branch prediction and cache
  behavior are best-case, so ~5 ns/NPC is a floor, not an expectation. A mixed-role, mixed-state workload should be
  added before any performance claim about a real town or battle.
- The Rust-direct and C-FFI numbers use separate harnesses. Differences include caller and compiler effects and are
  not a clean isolation of FFI overhead.
- Nothing here measures Unity marshalling, ECS observation gathering, or action execution. Those are more likely
  bottlenecks than the decision function.
- No memory or allocation measurement yet. The standard's "measure" list from the project handover
  (memory usage, large-battle performance, ML inference overhead) is still open.

## Results log

| Date | Run | Runner | Batch 10 / 100 / 500 / 1000 (C to FFI, ns/NPC) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-29 | Bench #3 | `ubuntu-latest` | 5.15 / 5.00 / 4.98 / 5.00 | All checks green after the rustfmt fix. Rust direct: 5.2 / 5.0 / 5.0 / 5.0. Uniform input. |
