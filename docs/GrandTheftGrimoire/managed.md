# Managed stack (`MidManStudio.Gtg.Managed`)

## Overview

GTG keeps two implementations of the same gameplay systems side by side.

- `Assets/MidManStudio/Gtg/ECS/` holds the original Entities, Unity Physics and
  Burst version. Every ECS-dependent file is wrapped in `#if GTG_ECS`, so the folder
  compiles to nothing unless that define is set. The sources are frozen, only the
  wrapper and the new location changed.
- `Assets/MidManStudio/Gtg/Managed/` holds a MonoBehaviour version with no ECS,
  Burst or Unity Physics dependency in its own code. It needs only `UnityEngine`,
  the Input System package and, for chemistry, `com.midmanstudio.alembic`.

Why two: the ECS stack does not run on the current development machine, see the
first entry in Fixes and Problems and `generalprobs.md`. Gameplay is built on the
Managed stack now, and the ECS stack stays ready for hardware that can run it.
The ECS folder moved with its `.meta` files, so script GUIDs did not change.

### Namespaces and names

Managed code lives under `MidManStudio.Gtg.Managed.<System>`, and every public type
carries a `Managed` prefix. Both stacks can therefore compile in one assembly
without a name clash. Inside these namespaces the simple names `Camera` and
`CharacterController` resolve to namespaces, so the Unity components are written as
`UnityEngine.Camera` and `UnityEngine.CharacterController`.

### Switching stacks

Managed only (current state):

1. Remove `com.unity.physics`, then `com.unity.entities`, in the Package Manager.
2. Leave `GTG_ECS` undefined.
3. `com.unity.burst`, `com.unity.collections` and `com.unity.mathematics` stay
   installed, because `com.midmanstudio.alembic` depends on them. The Managed code
   and the Alembic calls it makes run no Burst compiled code. Only
   `BondBatchAdapter` in Alembic has a Burst job, and GTG does not use it.

ECS and Managed together, or ECS only:

1. Add `com.unity.entities` and `com.unity.physics` at 1.3.10 back to the project.
2. Add `GTG_ECS` under Project Settings, Player, Other Settings, Scripting Define Symbols.
3. A scene uses one stack at a time. Remove the other stack's components from it.

A scene object that carries a component from a stack that is not compiled shows a
missing script. Delete it, or switch the define back.

### Scene setup (Managed)

1. Create an empty GameObject at the feet position, on solid ground. Add
   `ManagedCharacter`, which also adds a `CharacterController` shaped as a 2 m
   capsule, then `ManagedSpellCaster`.
2. Create a second empty GameObject. Add `ManagedCameraRig` and
   `ManagedChemicalHazardField`.
3. Press Play. With no camera assigned, the rig drives the main camera. A Cinemachine
   setup assigns its two camera objects on the rig and points the Follow target at
   the rig's `GTG Camera Target`.
4. Delete the old SubScene, `CharacterAuthoring` and `CharacterCameraBridge` objects.

Unity creates `.meta` files for the new scripts on first import. Commit them.

### Parity with the ECS stack

| System | ECS | Managed |
|---|---|---|
| Look, walk, jump, gravity | one `ISystem` per module, Burst jobs | one component, same order and same tuning values |
| Collision | own capsule sweep through Unity Physics | `UnityEngine.CharacterController` |
| Camera | `CharacterCameraBridge` copies the entity to GameObjects | `ManagedCameraRig` reads the component directly |
| Fireball | entities, command buffers, presentation system | list of shots stepped with raycasts, pooled views |
| Chemistry | impact entity, hazard entity, presentation system | static event, hazard objects, pooled views |
| NPC | present | not built yet |

Networking differs. Netcode for Entities needs the ECS stack. The Managed stack has
no prediction or rollback, and networked play on it would need Netcode for
GameObjects, see `GTG_REPO_CONVENTIONS.md` section 5.

## Modules

### `ManagedCharacterFeature.cs`

**What it does:** Flags enum with one bit per character module: Look, Move, Jump,
Gravity, Cast, plus `All`.

**Decisions:**
- Same module names as the ECS `CharacterFeature`, so a feature toggle means the
  same thing in both stacks.

### `ManagedCharacterInput.cs`

**What it does:** Polls keyboard, mouse and gamepad and returns one
`ManagedCharacterInputFrame` per call.

**Decisions:**
- Devices are read directly, as in the ECS input system.
- Mouse look and mouse fire count only while the cursor is locked, so the click that
  captures the cursor does not also fire.

### `ManagedCharacter.cs`

**What it does:** Kinematic character on `UnityEngine.CharacterController`. Each
frame it reads the input and runs look, walk, jump and gravity, then calls `Move`.

**Decisions:**
- The module order matches the ECS update order, and the defaults match
  `CharacterAuthoring`.
- The ground state comes from the `CollisionFlags` of the move. A rising character
  reports no floor contact, which gives the same "ground ignored while rising"
  behavior as the ECS ground system.
- Floor contact zeroes a downward speed, and gravity then holds the small ground
  stick speed, as in the ECS movement and gravity systems.
- The slope limit and skin width are written to the controller in `Awake`.
- When the character has no renderer, a capsule mesh is added as a child. Its
  collider is disabled before it is destroyed, because `Destroy` runs at the end of
  the frame and the controller would collide with its own body on the first move.
- Execution order is -50, so the caster and the rig read this frame's input.

### `ManagedSpellTypes.cs`

**What it does:** `ManagedSpellKind` and the `ManagedSpellImpact` struct.

### `ManagedSpellVfxMaterials.cs`

**What it does:** Builds unlit placeholder materials. It tries the URP Unlit shader,
then `Sprites/Default`, then `Unlit/Color`, and returns null if none exists.

### `ManagedSpellCaster.cs`

**What it does:** Fires fireballs. It spawns a shot when the fire button goes down,
the Cast module is on and the cooldown is over. Each step raycasts from the old
position to the new one and raises `Impact` on a hit.

**Decisions:**
- Hits on the caster's own colliders are skipped, like the ECS "ignore owner" ray.
- `Impact` is a static event, so the chemistry field needs no reference to the
  caster. It is cleared at `SubsystemRegistration`, because static state survives a
  play session when domain reload is off.
- Views are pooled spheres with a point light. The root object is created in `Awake`.

### `ManagedCameraRig.cs`

**What it does:** Owns the cursor and the view mode. Moves the follow target to the
eye point with yaw and pitch, switches the two camera objects, and draws the debug
overlay with the module toggles.

**Decisions:**
- With no camera objects assigned, the rig drives the main camera itself, and in
  third person it pulls the camera in front of walls with a linecast. This keeps the
  first test free of Cinemachine wiring.
- Execution order is 100 and the work is in `LateUpdate`, after the character.
- The overlay drops the ECS world, physics and command buffer lines, because there
  is no world.

### `ManagedChemistryTypes.cs`

**What it does:** `ManagedHazardType`, `ManagedChemicalHazard` and
`ManagedReactionResult`.

**Decisions:**
- `CurrentRadius` stays the authoritative footprint for later damage checks. The
  views only mirror it.

### `ManagedChemistryRecipe.cs`

**What it does:** Same recipe values as the ECS `ChemistryRecipe`, with `Mathf`
instead of `Unity.Mathematics`.

### `ManagedChemistryReactor.cs`

**What it does:** Runs the short Alembic simulation and counts formed bonds. The
calls are the same as in the ECS `ChemistryReactionSystem`.

**Decisions:**
- The native library is probed once. A missing library logs one warning, and every
  later impact returns an unconfirmed result without logging again.
- The reaction code is duplicated from the ECS system on purpose. The ECS file is
  frozen. The two copies merge into one shared class when the stacks are reunited.

### `ManagedChemicalHazardField.cs`

**What it does:** Subscribes to `ManagedSpellCaster.Impact`, runs the reaction,
creates a hazard, grows it, expires it and draws it as a translucent sphere.

**Decisions:**
- `Count` and `Get(index)` expose the live hazards for damage checks.
- Subscription happens in `OnEnable` and `OnDisable`, so a disabled field takes no
  impacts.

## CI and Workflows

- `.github/workflows/run-patch.yml` - runs `.mdix/patches/patch.mdix`. The current
  patch moves the system folders under `ECS/`, wraps the ECS files and adds the
  location notes to the docs. It is a one-shot pass. A second run skips the moves,
  reports an error for every file that is already wrapped, and repeats the doc notes.
- `.github/workflows/apply-replacements.yml` - applies the replacements archive that
  added the `Managed/` folder and this file.

## Fixes and Problems

### Stack split

- The ECS stack does not run on the development machine, a MacBook Pro from 2010
  on patched macOS Catalina. Burst compiled Entities code aborts with "Illegal
  instruction executed" while the default world is created. The abort leaves Unity
  Physics, the command buffer systems and the scene system half built, and the
  later errors (no physics world, no command buffer, entity from a different world,
  entity does not exist) follow from that. An empty SubScene and a scene with only
  the character reproduce it. The cause is not confirmed, and the working theory is
  Burst code generation for this CPU. The decision is to keep the ECS sources
  frozen behind `GTG_ECS` and build gameplay on the Managed stack.
- Not done: a Managed NPC. The NPC decision system and its Rust bridge stay ECS only.

### `ManagedCharacter.cs`

- `CharacterController.isGrounded` is not used, because it reflects only the last
  move. The `CollisionFlags` of the current move give the ground state.
